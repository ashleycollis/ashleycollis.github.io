            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
							Hi, I'm Ashley! I am an energetic software developer with a passion for coding applications that serve consumer needs. I have built fullstack web and mobile applications using Javascript along with relevant libraries.

							<p> My career goal has always been to pursue challenging and enjoyable work that improves the livelihood of as many people as possible. Before software development, I worked in marketing and legal services for a few years following my graduation from Cornell University. I was initially set on attending law school but shifted paths after discovering my love for software development. Programming is a fun way for me to make meaningful contributions to society on a large scale. I love expanding my skills and pushing to solve novel problems while building socially beneficial technology.
							</p>
							<br>
							<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
							In addition to Javascript, I have the most experiencing building applications with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, React Native, chai, and mocha. I learned the fundamentals of software engineering while pair programming and building applications in an agile environment at Fullstack Academy in 2019. Some of the projects I have worked on are an ecommerce website and a mobile productivity application.

						<h2>Offline</h2>
						 <p>
							 Besides programming, I really enjoy playing with dogs, yoga, Animal Crossing and trying to beat my personal biking record on the Peloton.
